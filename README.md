These are all the code that deals with the Microcontroller Model Micos 1860SMC Basic used in the Nanomaterials Lab at NUS. The combined system, **A**utomated **T**ranslating **L**aser with **A**ttenuation and **S**hutter (**ATLAS**), is now used for experiments, demostrations and remote lab access. A `conda-environmnt.yml` exists to facilitate the quick spinup of a working environment. 

There are documentation within each script but it is so far abit..messy, and more work is required to document this.
